= Why we need such tool =

Use case for this project is following. 

Source code of the projects needed to be deployed on web server. Changed classes need to be updated in the JARs. Also changed , Javascripts, HTML pages etc need to be updated as well. After each update of the source code tool can be run an update web server and run post update JMX methods and commands (e.g. for server restart). Also sometimes reverting of the changes need to be done to original version.
